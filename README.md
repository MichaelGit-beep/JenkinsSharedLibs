# JenkinsSharedLibs
Each shared library lives in its own repository. The repository has a specific structure that must be used. The first steps in using shared libraries is to set up that repository, and then configure the repository with Jenkins.

# SCM directory structure
The directory structure of a Shared Library repository is as follows:

```
(root)
+- src                     # Groovy source files
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
+- vars
|   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable
|   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable
+- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- bar.json    # static helper data for org.foo.Bar
```

The `src`, `resources` and `vars` directories are not required; each has its own behavior and may be included or omitted as needed. Let us look at each directory.

## src directory
The src directory uses a standard Java source directory structure. It is added to the classpath when executing Pipelines. You should rarely (preferably never) add anything to the src directory.

## vars directory
The `vars` directory contains scripts that define custom steps accessible from a Pipeline. All custom steps are defined in the root of the vars directory. The rules are:

- You can not use subfolders under var

- Each file should define one step

- The name of the file should be the name of that step, camelCased, with the .groovy suffix.

- The matching .txt file, if present, can contain documentation. This is processed through the systemâ€™s configured markup formatter.

## resources directory
The libraryResource step reads files from the resources directory and returns the content as a plain string. You can use subdirectories in the resources directory. Be sure to give each directory a name that is meaningful to you.

## Other directories
Other directories under the root of the shared library are reserved for future enhancements.



# Add Shared Lib
To configure a shared library, navigate to Manage Jenkins  Configure System on the Manage Jenkins page and go to the Global Pipeline Libraries section. When you click Add,. the configuration page for a Global Pipeline Library is displayed:

global lib config
In this unit, we only discuss using global shared libraries.

## Shared library configuration notes
- Set Default version to master to have Pipelines call custom steps from the master branch.

- If Allow default version to be overridden is enabled, a Pipeline can override this to call custom steps from other branches using the @Library annotation.

- When Load implicitly is enabled, the default branch is automatically available to all Pipelines; custom steps can also be loaded manually using the @Library annotation.

- When you select Modern SCM for the Retrieval method, the Source Code Management page pops up. Use this page to configure the repository that holds your shared library to Jenkins:


Populate these fields as you would when configuring any repository to Jenkins.

## Global libraries versus folder-level libraries
Shared libraries can be configured either as global libraries or folder-level libraries. Consider the following:

- Global libraries configured in Jenkins are considered trusted; steps from this library run outside the Groovy sandbox.

- Libraries configured at multibranch/folder level are considered not trusted and run inside the Groovy sandbox. Using libraries at multibranch/folder level incurs less risk to the Jenkins server than using libraries outside the sandbox.

You can also configure automatic shared libraries.


# Task: Configure a global pipeline library
In this exercise you will:

- Configure a global pipeline library.

- Create and run a simple Jenkinsfile to verify that the library is set up correctly.

## Task: Configure a global pipeline library
1. From the Jenkins Dashboard, select Manage Jenkins in the left navigation bar.

2. Under System Configuration, select Configure System.

3. Scroll down to Global Pipeline Libraries.

4. Select Add and set the following values:

    - Name: GenericLibs

    - Default version: master

    - Load implicitly: unchecked

    - Allow default version to be overridden: checked

    - Include @Library changes in job recent changes: checked

5. Under Retrieval method, select Modern SCM.

6. Select Git and set the following values:

    - Project Repository: https://github.com/MichaelGit-beep/JenkinsSharedLibs.git


Select Save.

## Create shared library function
1. In shared library SCM create a folder `vars`
2. Create a file named `vars/helloWorldSimple.groovy`
3. Content of vars/helloWorldSimple.groovy
```groovy
def call() {
    sh "echo Hello World"
}
```

## Task: Verify that the library is set up correctly
To verify that the library is set up correctly, create and run a simple Jenkinsfile:

1. From the Jenkins Dashboard, select New Item.

2. Enter the item name GenericLibs-test.

3. Select Pipeline.

4. Select OK.

5. Scroll down to the Pipeline text section and paste the following into the Script text box:
```groovy
@Library('GenericLibs') _

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('verify') {
            steps {
                helloWorldSimple()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

6. Select Save.

7. Select Build Now in the left navigation bar.

8. Under Build History, select the blue ball to the left of #1 to open the Console Output.

9. Scroll down and verify that you see
```
Hello world, fred
```

# Call the shared library custom step

## HelloWorldSimple example
Jenkinsfile
```groovy
@Library('GenericLibs') _
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('hello') {
      steps {
        helloWorldSimple("Fred","Friday")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
vars/helloWorldSimple.groovy
```groovy
def call(String name, String dayOfWeek) {
  sh "echo Hello World ${name}. It is ${dayOfWeek}."
}
```

## HelloWorld example

Jenkinsfile
```groovy
@Library('GenericLibs') _
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('hello') {
      steps {
        helloWorld(name: "Fred", dayOfWeek: "Friday")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

vars/helloWorld.groovy
```groovy
def call(Map config = [:]) {
  sh "echo Hello World ${config.name}. It is ${config.dayOfWeek}."
}
```
