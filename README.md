# JenkinsSharedLibs
Each shared library lives in its own repository. The repository has a specific structure that must be used. The first steps in using shared libraries is to set up that repository, and then configure the repository with Jenkins.

# SCM directory structure
The directory structure of a Shared Library repository is as follows:

(root)
+- src                     # Groovy source files
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
+- vars
|   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable
|   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable
+- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- bar.json    # static helper data for org.foo.Bar
The `src`, `resources` and `vars` directories are not required; each has its own behavior and may be included or omitted as needed. Let us look at each directory.

## src directory
The src directory uses a standard Java source directory structure. It is added to the classpath when executing Pipelines. You should rarely (preferably never) add anything to the src directory.

## vars directory
The `vars` directory contains scripts that define custom steps accessible from a Pipeline. All custom steps are defined in the root of the vars directory. The rules are:

- You can not use subfolders under var

- Each file should define one step

- The name of the file should be the name of that step, camelCased, with the .groovy suffix.

- The matching .txt file, if present, can contain documentation. This is processed through the systemâ€™s configured markup formatter.

## resources directory
The libraryResource step reads files from the resources directory and returns the content as a plain string. You can use subdirectories in the resources directory. Be sure to give each directory a name that is meaningful to you.

## Other directories
Other directories under the root of the shared library are reserved for future enhancements.
